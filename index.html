And as the popular nursery rhyme "London Bridge is falling down" implies, the bridge never actually fell down in real life. It has 2 towers, in victorian gothic style. It is connected with the walkways and the machine below the base lifts up so that it can allow the water to pass within it.</p>

It was named after Gustave Eiffel, who was also the one who designed it. It was once yellow and created during the French Revolution. You would be amazed to know that the Eiffel Tower moves (as it get affected by weather). It's located in Paris, the capital city of France, in Western Europe. </p>

It was built in the honour to celebrate Canada's centennial of 1967. The construction took 15 WHOLE MONTHS and was built to withstand serious weather conditions (betcha didn't know that.) In 1988, Calgary hosted "Winter Olympics" due to which cauldron was installed on the top of the tower and basically turned it into a HUGE torch.</p>

                <p>I haven't seen this film but it is very cool despite some of the viewing and I just look forward to seeing many other fun animations too. The animation in the movie is very realistic.

                    The movie starts with a story of 2 siblings.

                    A new baby arrives at the house of the Templeton family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator -- a wild 7-year-old (and a half) named Tim (Full name is Timothy Leslie Templeton. Leslie? That's a girl name, dude!). The most unusual Boss Baby (voiced by Alec Baldwin) arrives at Tim's house in a cab, wearing a business tuxedo and carrying a suitcase. The instant sibling envy must soon be put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is actually a business baby on an agenda, and only he can help assist a risky job that involves a skirmish between puppies and babies. Based on a popular book by Marla Frazee.</p>

                <p>This 2017 film is based on a popular 2010 animated series from Russia. It is based on a classic tale by a Russian author.

                    The film is about fixies, tiny humanlike creatures who live in machines and appliances. They fix machines and appliances with backpack-like objects from pack-o-mats from which they can summon any tool. But they have to keep their existence a secret from humans. Now they have a human friend named Tom-Thomas (Full name is Thomas Wearington Jr. Possibly named after his father.). And he has promised to keep them a secret.

                    That becomes hard.

                    When one of the fixie classmates transforms into a super-powered rascal, it is up to his fixie friends, Tom-Thomas, and a lab professor named Professor Eugenius to help save the day.</p>

                <p>The `Peanuts' comic strips were always a staple of daily life for many people around the world for almost 50 years until the original production finished in the 2000s. Now, the classic cartoons are coming to life -- in animated version at least -- in this series. The show uses a pen-and-ink animation type along with textured backgrounds and framing to emulate the looks of the original strips as they used to appear in paper. `Peanuts' aims to bring the classic adventures of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the gang to a new chapter that is many times as familiar with 2015's computer-animated `The Peanuts Movie' than the original graphic papers.</p>

                            In the first book of this full-color fantasy graphic novel series filled with humor and hijinks, the fate of the land of Nothing hinges on Nathan and an unlikely team of magical beings to save the day—perfect for fans of Amulet and Estranged.

                            Welcome to Nothing! Despite its name, this is a fantastic land where humans and magical volken coexist peacefully—at least they try . . .

                            This is the tale of Nathan, an ordinary human (or so he thinks) living an ordinary life (or so he wishes). Everything changes when he meets Haven, a mysterious creature who is neither human nor volken. Oh, and the two of them are being chased by volken mercenaries—a grumpy wolf named Bardou and a delightful crow named Sina.

                            Nathan soon learns he has mysterious powers, even though humans aren’t supposed to have magic. But there’s no time to dwell on that because this discovery sets the group on a perilous quest across windswept terrain, through haunted forests, and in ancient tombs. Nathan and his unlikely friends must prevent an impending war and defeat a dark evil to save their land.

                            No pressure, of course. If they fail, everything will turn into, well . . . nothing.<br>
